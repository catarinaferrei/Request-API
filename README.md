# Request-API
A small REST API written in Kotlin that submits a request and returns a status

This API is supposed to emulate a tool that a developer can submit a request (e.g., i want to change line 4 in the class SchoolService) and the reviewer will update the request with a status.

To build it run ./gradlew clean build

To access the API via browser http://localhost:8080/request/items
